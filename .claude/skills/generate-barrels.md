Run all code generation scripts in the correct order to keep barrel exports in sync with the codebase.

Use this after:
- Adding a new entity, hook, component, or type
- Renaming or deleting exports
- After running `/db-sync` or `/new-entity`
- Any time you see "cannot find module" or missing re-export errors

---

## Step 1 — Check what needs regenerating

Before running, briefly check what changed to determine which generators are actually needed:
- New/removed **enum files** → run `generate:enums`
- New/removed **type files** → run `generate:types`
- New/removed **hook files** → run `generate:hooks`
- New/removed **component files** → run `generate:components`
- New/removed **API routes** → run `generate:api-routes`

When in doubt, run all of them (it's fast and safe).

---

## Step 2 — Run generators in order

Always run in this sequence (later generators may depend on earlier outputs):

```bash
npm run generate:enums
npm run generate:types
npm run generate:hooks
npm run generate:components
npm run generate:api-routes
```

Each script scans its target directory and overwrites the relevant barrel `index.ts` files.

---

## Step 3 — Verify with TypeScript

```bash
npm run tsc
```

If there are errors after regeneration, common causes:
- A file exports a type that collides with another barrel export → check `src/types/index.ts` for duplicate names
- A hook was renamed but its old export is still referenced somewhere → search with grep
- An API route key is missing in `src/lib/api-routes.ts` → add it manually (this file is NOT auto-generated)

---

## Step 4 — Fix imports if needed

```bash
npm run fix:imports
```

Runs ESLint auto-fix for import ordering. Run this if the generators added imports that violate the project's import-order rules.

## Notes on barrel files

- `src/hooks/index.ts` — auto-generated, groups hooks by entity
- `src/types/index.ts` — auto-generated, re-exports all entity types and schemas
- `src/components/index.ts` — auto-generated
- `src/lib/api-routes.ts` — **NOT auto-generated**, must be updated manually when adding new API routes
- `src/lib/translations/index.ts` — **NOT auto-generated**, must be updated manually when adding new translation files
- `src/enums/*.ts` barrels — auto-generated by `generate:enums`

Report which barrel files were updated and whether `tsc` passed cleanly.
