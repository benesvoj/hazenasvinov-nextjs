# Database Types

This directory contains auto-generated TypeScript types from the Supabase database schema.

## Files

- **`supabase.ts`** - Raw types generated by Supabase CLI
  - Contains all tables, views, functions, and enums
  - **⚠️ AUTO-GENERATED** - Do not edit manually
  - Regenerated with: `npm run db:generate-types`

## Regenerating Types

After any database migration or schema change:

```bash
npm run db:generate-types
```

This will:
1. Connect to your Supabase database
2. Generate types for all tables and views
3. Split types into entity-specific schema files

## Usage

**Don't use these types directly in your application code.**

Instead, use the entity-specific schema types:

```typescript
// ❌ Don't do this
import {Tables} from '@/types/database/supabase';
type Member = Tables['members']['Row'];

// ✅ Do this instead
import {MemberSchema} from '@/types/entities/member/schema/membersSchema';
```

The entity-specific schemas are cleaner and better documented.
