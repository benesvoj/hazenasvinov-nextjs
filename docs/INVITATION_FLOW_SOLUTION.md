# User Invitation Flow - Complete Solution

## Problem Analysis

The original system had a basic email template that redirected users to the homepage after accepting invitations, leaving them without a clear path to set up their password and access the system.

## Solution Overview

We've created a complete user invitation flow that provides a professional, user-friendly experience for new users joining the TJ Sokol Svinov system.

## What Was Created

### 1. **Professional Email Templates**
- **HTML Template** (`email-templates/invite-user-template.html`)
  - Modern, responsive design with club branding
  - Czech language content
  - Clear call-to-action button
  - Security information and contact details

- **Plain Text Template** (`email-templates/invite-user-template.txt`)
  - Fallback for email clients that don't support HTML
  - Clean, readable format

### 2. **Set Password Page** (`src/app/set-password/page.tsx`)
- Dedicated page for new users to set their password
- Password strength validation
- Professional UI with club branding
- Automatic role-based redirect after password setup
- Error handling for expired/invalid links

### 3. **Updated Routes** (`src/routes/routes.ts`)
- Added `setPassword: '/set-password'` to public routes

### 4. **Documentation**
- **Quick Setup Guide** (`docs/QUICK_EMAIL_SETUP.md`)
- **Comprehensive Setup Guide** (`docs/EMAIL_TEMPLATES_SETUP.md`)
- **This Solution Overview** (`docs/INVITATION_FLOW_SOLUTION.md`)
