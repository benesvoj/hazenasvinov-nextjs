# External Players Support for Lineup Management

## Overview
This enhancement adds support for external players (players from other clubs) in the lineup management system. When managing lineups for matches that don't involve your own club, you can now add players by entering their name and registration number manually, rather than being limited to only your club's members.

## Key Features

### üîÑ **Auto-Completion & Memory**
- **Smart Recognition**: When you enter a registration number that was used before, the system automatically fills in the player's name and other details
- **Persistent Storage**: All external players are stored in the database for future use
- **Search Functionality**: Quick search through previously added external players

### üéØ **Flexible Player Management**
- **Toggle Between Types**: Switch between internal players (from your club) and external players (from other clubs)
- **Complete Information**: Store name, surname, registration number, position, and club information
- **Club Identification**: Select from existing teams or enter custom club name
- **Validation**: Same validation rules apply to external players as internal ones

### üèÜ **Handball Federation Compliance**
- **Position Requirements**: Must specify goalkeeper or field player
- **Count Validation**: Enforces minimum/maximum player counts per position
- **Coach Rules**: Maximum 3 coaches per team, minimum 1 head coach required
- **Role Assignment**: Can assign starter, captain, and vice-captain roles

## Database Setup
