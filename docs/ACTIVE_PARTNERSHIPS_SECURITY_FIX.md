# Active Partnerships Security Fix

## 🚨 Security Warning

**Issue**: View `public.active_partnerships` is defined with the `SECURITY DEFINER` property.

**Description**: Detects views defined with the `SECURITY DEFINER` property. These views enforce Postgres permissions and row level security policies (RLS) of the view creator, rather than that of the querying user.

## 🔍 Root Cause Analysis

The `active_partnerships` view was likely created with the `SECURITY DEFINER` property, which can be a security risk because:

1. **Privilege Escalation**: The view runs with the privileges of the view creator, not the querying user
2. **Bypass RLS**: Row Level Security policies of the querying user are bypassed
3. **Unintended Access**: Users might access data they shouldn't have access to

## 🛠️ Solution

### 1. Recreate the View Without SECURITY DEFINER

The `active_partnerships` view only contains public partnership information for active partnerships, so it doesn't need `SECURITY DEFINER`:

```sql
-- Drop and recreate the view without SECURITY DEFINER
DROP VIEW IF EXISTS active_partnerships;

CREATE OR REPLACE VIEW active_partnerships AS
SELECT 
    'main_partner' as partner_type,
    id,
    name,
    level,
    start_date,
    end_date,
    status,
    created_at
FROM main_partners 
WHERE status = 'active'

UNION ALL

SELECT 
    'business_partner' as partner_type,
    id,
    name,
    partnership_type as level,
    start_date,
    NULL as end_date,
    status,
    created_at
FROM business_partners 
WHERE status = 'active'

UNION ALL

SELECT 
    'media_partner' as partner_type,
    id,
    name,
    media_type as level,
    start_date,
    NULL as end_date,
    status,
    created_at
FROM media_partners 
WHERE status = 'active';
```

### 2. Apply Proper Permissions

```sql
-- Grant appropriate permissions
GRANT SELECT ON active_partnerships TO authenticated;
```

## 📋 How to Apply the Fix

### Option 1: Automated Script (Recommended)

1. **Set up environment variables** in `.env.local`:
   ```bash
   NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=your_supabase_url
   SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=your_service_role_key
   ```

2. **Run the automated script**:
   ```bash
   cd scripts
   node fix-active-partnerships-security.js
   ```

### Option 2: Manual SQL Execution

1. **Go to Supabase Dashboard** → **SQL Editor**
2. **Copy and paste** the contents of `scripts/fix_active_partnerships_security.sql`
3. **Execute the SQL script**
4. **Verify** the security warning disappears

## 🔍 Data Sources

The view combines data from three partner tables:

1. **Main Partners** (`main_partners`)
   - High-level sponsors with end dates
   - Includes level, start_date, end_date

   - Business-level partnerships
   - Includes partnership_type, start_date (no end_date)

3. **Media Partners** (`media_partners`)
   - Media and promotional partnerships
   - Includes media_type, start_date (no end_date)

## 🧪 Verification

After applying the fix, verify:

1. **Security warning disappears** in Supabase Dashboard
2. **View still works** for authenticated users
3. **No functionality is broken** in the application
4. **Proper permissions** are in place
5. **All partner types** are properly displayed

## 📝 Notes

- This view contains only public partnership information
- Only active partnerships are shown (status = 'active')
