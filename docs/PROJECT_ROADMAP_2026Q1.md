# Project Roadmap - Q1 2026
## Welcome Back Assessment & Action Plan

**Date:** January 16, 2026
**Branch:** `architecture-layer-refactor`
**Status:** 🔴 CRITICAL BUILD FAILURE - IMMEDIATE ACTION REQUIRED

---

## 🚨 CRITICAL BLOCKERS (Fix First)

### 1. **BUILD FAILURE** 🔴 BLOCKING PRODUCTION
**Issue:** Server/Client boundary violation
**Error:** `createDataFetchHook()` being called from server-side code
**Impact:** Cannot build for production, cannot deploy
**Location:** Build fails when processing `/api/attendance/statistics/route.ts`

**Root Cause:** Webpack is including client-side hooks in the server bundle through indirect imports.

**Fix Options:**
```typescript
// Option A: Add 'use server' directive to API routes that need it
'use server'
export async function GET(request: NextRequest) { ... }

// Option B: Check if helpers are inadvertently importing hooks
// Verify src/helpers/index.ts doesn't pull in client code

// Option C: Use dynamic imports for problematic dependencies
const { helper } = await import('@/helpers/attendance/helpers');
```

**Action:** Investigate and fix the import chain TODAY before any other work.

---

### 2. **CANNOT PUSH TO REMOTE** 🟡 BLOCKING COLLABORATION
**Issue:** Pre-push hook failing due to test failures
**Impact:** Cannot share work with team, cannot deploy
**Details:**
- 6 tests failing in `createDataFetchHook.test.ts` (pre-existing)
- Tests were failing BEFORE your recent work
- 34 tests passing, 6 failing consistently

**Fix Options:**
```bash
# Option A: Fix the 6 tests (recommended)
npm test -- src/hooks/factories/__tests__/createDataFetchHook.test.ts

# Option B: Temporary bypass (NOT recommended)
git push --no-verify

# Option C: Disable pre-push hook temporarily
# Edit .husky/pre-push
```

**Action:** Fix tests OR get team consensus on temporarily bypassing.

## 🎯 RECOMMENDED ACTION PLAN

### Phase 1: UNBLOCK (2-4 hours)
**Goal:** Get to a buildable, deployable state

#### Step 1: Fix Build Error (PRIORITY 1)
```bash
# 1. Identify the import chain
npm run build 2>&1 | tee build-error.log

# 2. Check helpers barrel exports
# Ensure src/helpers/index.ts doesn't import client hooks

# 3. Add server boundaries if needed
# Add 'use server' or dynamic imports

# 4. Verify fix
npm run build
```

#### Step 2: Handle Test Failures (PRIORITY 2)
```bash
# Option A: Fix the tests (2-3 hours estimated)
npm test -- createDataFetchHook.test.ts

# Option B: Document and skip temporarily
# Update .husky/pre-push to skip specific tests
# Create ticket to fix later
```

#### Step 3: Merge to Main (PRIORITY 3)
```bash
# Once build + tests pass:
git checkout main
git merge architecture-layer-refactor
git push origin main
```

**Estimated Time:** 2-4 hours
**Success Criteria:** ✅ Build passes, ✅ Can push to remote, ✅ On main branch

---

### Phase 2: STABILIZE (1-2 days)
**Goal:** Update dependencies, complete pending features

#### Step 1: Update Non-Breaking Packages
```bash
# Update minor versions first (safer)
npx npm-check-updates -u --target minor
npm install
npm test
npm run build
```

#### Step 2: Complete Attendance Features
**Status:** 80% complete, DB migrations pending

**Remaining Work:**
```bash
# 1. Run database migrations (15 min)
psql $DATABASE_URL -f scripts/migrations/20251125_create_attendance_statistics_mv.sql
psql $DATABASE_URL -f scripts/migrations/20251125_create_attendance_functions.sql
psql $DATABASE_URL -f scripts/migrations/20251125_create_attendance_triggers.sql

# 2. Test API endpoint
curl "http://localhost:3000/api/attendance/statistics?categoryId=X&seasonId=Y"

# 3. Verify UI displays correctly
```

**Files Ready:**
- ✅ API Route: `src/app/api/attendance/statistics/route.ts`
- ✅ Components: AttendanceStatisticsLazy, SummaryCards, etc.
- ✅ Helpers: generateInsights, generateRecommendations
- ⏳ DB Migrations: scripts/migrations/*.sql (ready to run)

**See:** `docs/refactoring/PHASE1_QUICK_REFERENCE.md`

#### Step 3: Update Major Dependencies (RISKY)
```bash
# React 19 - requires careful testing
npm install react@19 react-dom@19 @types/react@19 @types/react-dom@19

# Next.js 16.1
npm install next@16.1.2

# Zod 4 - check for breaking changes
npm install zod@4

# Vitest 4 - update test configs
npm install vitest@4 @vitest/coverage-v8@4

# Test everything
npm test
npm run build
npm run dev # Manual testing
```

**Estimated Time:** 1-2 days
**Risk:** Medium (breaking changes expected)

---

### Phase 3: ENHANCE (ongoing)
**Goal:** Finish refactoring, add new features

#### Refactoring Progress
**Completed:**
- ✅ Blogs (full refactor)
- ✅ Todos (full refactor)
- ✅ Comments (full refactor)
- ✅ Grants (factory pattern)
- ✅ Seasons (refactor)
- ✅ Category Lineups (80% complete)
- ✅ Training Sessions (queries + mutations)
- ✅ Attendance Records (queries + mutations)

**In Progress:**
- 🔄 Attendance Statistics (DB migrations pending)
- 🔄 Category Lineup Members (TypeScript errors exist)

**Not Started:**
- ⏸️ Members refactor
- ⏸️ Matches refactor
- ⏸️ Videos refactor
- ⏸️ Other entities

**See:** `docs/refactoring/` folder for detailed guides

#### Architecture Improvements
**Implemented:**
- ✅ Factory patterns (createCRUDHook, createDataFetchHook, createFormHook)
- ✅ Layered architecture (data, business, state)
- ✅ Centralized queries folder
- ✅ Type safety improvements

**Next Steps:**
- Add end-to-end tests
- Implement React Query for caching
- Add error boundaries
- Improve loading states
- Add optimistic updates

## ⚠️ WARNINGS & GOTCHAS

### Build Issues
- ❗ **Never import client hooks in API routes**
- ❗ **Check barrel exports** (index.ts files can accidentally import client code)
- ❗ **Use `'use client'` and `'use server'` directives explicitly**

### Testing
- ❗ **6 pre-existing failing tests** in createDataFetchHook
- ❗ **Pre-push hook will block** until tests pass
- ❗ **Don't use `--no-verify`** without team agreement

### Package Updates
- ❗ **React 19 has breaking changes** (especially types)
- ❗ **Zod 4 has breaking changes** (check schemas)
- ❗ **Vitest 4 requires config updates**
- ❗ **Test thoroughly after any major update**

### Database
- ❗ **Attendance migrations not yet run** on production
- ❗ **Always backup before migrations**
- ❗ **Test migrations on dev/staging first**

---

## 🚀 GETTING STARTED TODAY

### Immediate Actions (30 minutes)
```bash
# 1. Check build error details
npm run build 2>&1 | tee build-error.log
cat build-error.log

# 2. Check helpers imports
cat src/helpers/index.ts
grep -r "createDataFetchHook" src/helpers/

# 3. Check test failures
npm test -- createDataFetchHook.test.ts

# 4. Review this document
cat docs/PROJECT_ROADMAP_2026Q1.md
```

### Priority Order
1. 🔴 **Fix build error** (blocks everything)
2. 🟡 **Handle test failures** (blocks git push)
3. 🟢 **Merge to main** (stabilize)
4. 🔵 **Update packages** (modernize)
5. ⚪ **New features** (deliver value)

---

## 📞 QUESTIONS TO RESOLVE

Before proceeding, clarify:
1. **Do new features require the refactoring to be complete?**
   - If yes → Finish refactoring first
   - If no → Stabilize and start features in parallel

2. **What's the priority: speed or quality?**
   - Speed → Fix build, bypass tests, ship features
   - Quality → Fix tests, finish refactoring, then features

3. **Is the attendance feature critical?**
   - If yes → Run DB migrations in Phase 1
   - If no → Defer to Phase 2

4. **Can we update React to v19 now?**
   - Major version bump, possible breaking changes
   - Recommend testing on staging first

---

## 🎯 RECOMMENDED APPROACH

**My Recommendation:** Take the "Quality First" path:

1. **Today:** Fix build error (2 hours)
2. **Tomorrow:** Fix or document test failures (3 hours)
3. **Day 3:** Merge to main and update minor packages (2 hours)
4. **Day 4-5:** Run attendance migrations and test (4 hours)
5. **Week 2:** Update major packages with thorough testing (8 hours)
6. **Week 3+:** Start new features from stable base

**Why this approach?**
- ✅ Ensures stable foundation
- ✅ Reduces risk of compounding issues
- ✅ Makes debugging new features easier
- ✅ Improves team collaboration
- ✅ Better code quality long-term

**Alternative "Speed First" path:**
1. Fix build error only
2. Bypass tests temporarily
3. Start new features immediately
4. Fix technical debt later

**Trade-offs:**
- ⚠️ Higher risk of bugs
- ⚠️ Harder to debug issues
- ⚠️ Technical debt accumulates
- ✅ Faster feature delivery

---

## 📝 NEXT STEPS

Let me know:
1. Which path do you want to take? (Quality First vs Speed First)
2. Should I help fix the build error now?
3. What are the most urgent new features?
4. Any other concerns or priorities?
