# User Role Security Fix

## 🚨 Security Issue

Supabase detected that the `user_role_summary` view was exposing sensitive `auth.users` data (including email addresses) to the `authenticated` role, which could allow users to see other users' personal information.

## 🔒 Solution

The security issue has been fixed by:

1. **Removing the insecure view** that exposed `auth.users` data
2. **Creating a secure view** that only exposes data from `user_profiles` and related tables
3. **Adding secure functions** for accessing user data with proper access controls

## 📋 Changes Made

### 1. Secure View: `user_role_summary`
- **Before**: Exposed email addresses and other auth.users data to all authenticated users
- **After**: Only exposes user profile data (user_id, role), roles, and category assignments (no email addresses or full names)

### 2. New Secure Functions

#### `get_current_user_summary()`
- Returns current user's complete data including email
- Only returns data for the authenticated user
- Safe for any authenticated user to call

#### `get_user_summary_by_id(user_id)`
- Returns any user's complete data including email
- **Admin only** - requires admin role
- Includes security check to prevent unauthorized access

## 🔧 How to Fix

### Option 1: Automated Fix (Recommended)
```bash
cd scripts
node fix-user-role-security.js
```

### Option 2: Manual Fix
1. Go to your Supabase SQL Editor
2. Run the SQL script: `scripts/fix_user_role_summary_security.sql`
3. Verify the changes were applied successfully

## 📝 Code Updates Required

### Before (Insecure)
```typescript
// This exposed email addresses to all users
const { data } = await supabase
  .from('user_role_summary')
  .select('*')
  .eq('user_id', userId);
```

### After (Secure)

#### For Current User Data
```typescript
// Get current user's complete data (including email)
const { data } = await supabase
  .rpc('get_current_user_summary');
```

#### For Admin Access to Any User
```typescript
// Get any user's data (admin only)
const { data } = await supabase
  .rpc('get_user_summary_by_id', { target_user_id: userId });
```

#### For Public Data (No Email)
```typescript
// Get user data without email (safe for all users)
const { data } = await supabase
  .from('user_role_summary')
  .select('*')
  .eq('user_id', userId);
```

## 🔍 Verification

After applying the fix, verify that:

1. **Security Warning is Gone**: Check Supabase dashboard for security warnings
2. **Application Still Works**: Test all user role functionality
3. **Email Access is Controlled**: Verify only admins can access other users' emails

## 📊 Data Access Matrix

| Function/View | Current User Email | Other User Email | Other User Data | Access Level |
|---------------|-------------------|------------------|-----------------|--------------|
| `user_role_summary` | ❌ | ❌ | ✅ | All authenticated |
| `get_current_user_summary()` | ✅ | ❌ | ✅ | All authenticated |
| `get_user_summary_by_id()` | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | Admin only |

## 🛡️ Security Benefits

- **Data Privacy**: Users can no longer see other users' email addresses
- **Role-Based Access**: Admin functions require proper authorization
- **Audit Trail**: All access is logged and controlled
- **Compliance**: Meets data protection requirements

## 🚀 Migration Guide

### Step 1: Apply the Database Fix
Run the security fix script or SQL manually.

### Step 2: Update Application Code
Search for all uses of `user_role_summary` and replace with appropriate secure functions.

### Step 3: Test Thoroughly
- Test user login and profile access
- Test admin user management
- Test coach portal functionality
- Verify no email addresses are exposed inappropriately

### Step 4: Monitor
- Check Supabase logs for any security warnings
- Monitor application functionality
- Ensure all features work as expected
