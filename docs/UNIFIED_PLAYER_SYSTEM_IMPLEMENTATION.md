# Unified Player System Implementation Guide

## üéØ Overview

This guide provides a complete implementation of the unified player system that consolidates internal and external players into a single database table with advanced loaning functionality.

## üöÄ Key Features

### ‚úÖ **Unified Player Management**
- Single `members` table for all players (internal + external)
- `is_external` flag to distinguish player types
- Enhanced player information (position, jersey number, club tracking)

### ‚úÖ **Advanced Loaning System**
- Complete loan lifecycle management
- Support for temporary, permanent, and youth loans
- Automatic club tracking and updates
- Loan history and statistics

### ‚úÖ **Enhanced Analytics**
- Unified statistics across all players
- Club-level player summaries
- Loan tracking and reporting
- Performance analysis capabilities

## üìã Implementation Steps

### Step 1: Database Migration

Run the migration script to set up the unified system:

```sql
-- Execute in Supabase SQL Editor
\i scripts/unified_player_system_migration.sql
```

**What this script does:**
- Adds new columns to `members` table
- Migrates existing external players data
- Creates `player_loans` table
- Sets up functions and triggers
- Creates performance indexes
- Establishes RLS policies

### Step 2: Update Application Code

The following files have been updated/created:

#### **New TypeScript Types:**
- `src/types/playerLoan.ts` - Loan management types
- `src/types/unifiedPlayer.ts` - Unified player types
- Updated `src/types/member.ts` - Enhanced member interface
- Updated `src/types/lineup.ts` - Enhanced lineup player interface

#### **New Hooks:**
- `src/hooks/useUnifiedPlayers.ts` - Unified player management
- `src/hooks/usePlayerLoans.ts` - Loan management
- Updated `src/hooks/useLineupData.ts` - Enhanced lineup functionality

#### **New UI Components:**
- `src/components/loaning/PlayerLoanModal.tsx` - Create/edit loans
- `src/components/loaning/PlayerLoansList.tsx` - Display loans
- `src/components/loaning/LoaningManagement.tsx` - Complete loan management
- `src/components/players/UnifiedPlayerManager.tsx` - Enhanced player management

### Step 3: Database Functions

The migration creates several useful functions:

#### **Player Management:**
```sql
-- Search player-manager with filters
SELECT * FROM search_players('search_term', club_id, is_external, position);

-- Get player's current club
SELECT get_player_current_club(player_id);
```

#### **Loan Management:**
```sql
-- Create a new loan
SELECT create_player_loan(
  player_id, from_club_id, to_club_id, 
  loan_start_date, loan_end_date, loan_type, notes
);

-- End a loan
SELECT end_player_loan(loan_id);
```

### Step 4: Integration Points

#### **Lineup Management:**
The lineup system now supports:
- Unified player selection (internal + external)
- Automatic player creation for external players
- Enhanced player information display
- Club tracking in lineups

#### **Member Management:**
Enhanced member management with:
- External player support
- Position and jersey number tracking
- Club relationship management
- Active/inactive status

## üîß Usage Examples

### Creating a New External Player

```typescript
import { useUnifiedPlayers } from '@/hooks/useUnifiedPlayers';

const { savePlayer } = useUnifiedPlayers();

const newPlayer = await savePlayer({
  registration_number: 'EXT-2024-0001',
  name: 'Jan',
  surname: 'Nov√°k',
  is_external: true,
  current_club_id: 'club-uuid',
  position: 'field_player',
  jersey_number: 10,
  is_active: true,
  sex: 'male',
  functions: []
});
```

### Creating a Player Loan

```typescript
import { usePlayerLoans } from '@/hooks/usePlayerLoans';

const { createLoan } = usePlayerLoans();

const loan = await createLoan({
  player_id: 'player-uuid',
  from_club_id: 'from-club-uuid',
  to_club_id: 'to-club-uuid',
  loan_start_date: '2024-01-01',
  loan_end_date: '2024-06-30',
  loan_type: 'temporary',
  notes: 'Sez√≥nn√≠ p≈Øjƒçka'
});
```

### Searching Players

```typescript
import { useUnifiedPlayers } from '@/hooks/useUnifiedPlayers';

const { searchPlayers } = useUnifiedPlayers();

const players = await searchPlayers({
  search_term: 'Nov√°k',
  is_external: true,
  position: 'goalkeeper'
});
```

## üìä Database Schema

### Enhanced Members Table

```sql
CREATE TABLE members (
    id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
    registration_number VARCHAR(50) UNIQUE NOT NULL,
    name VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,
    surname VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,
    date_of_birth DATE,
    category_id UUID REFERENCES categories(id),
    sex VARCHAR(10) NOT NULL,
    functions TEXT[] DEFAULT '{}',
    -- New unified player fields
    is_external BOOLEAN DEFAULT FALSE,
    core_club_id UUID REFERENCES teams(id),
    current_club_id UUID REFERENCES teams(id),
    external_club_name VARCHAR(200),
    position VARCHAR(50),
    jersey_number INTEGER,
    is_active BOOLEAN DEFAULT TRUE,
    created_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT NOW(),
    updated_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT NOW()
);
```

### Player Loans Table

```sql
CREATE TABLE player_loans (
    id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
    player_id UUID NOT NULL REFERENCES members(id),
    from_club_id UUID REFERENCES teams(id),
    to_club_id UUID NOT NULL REFERENCES teams(id),
    loan_start_date DATE NOT NULL,
    loan_end_date DATE,
    loan_type VARCHAR(50) DEFAULT 'temporary',
    status VARCHAR(50) DEFAULT 'active',
    notes TEXT,
    created_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT NOW(),
    updated_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT NOW(),
    created_by UUID REFERENCES auth.users(id)
);
```

## üé® UI Components Usage

### Loaning Management

```tsx
import LoaningManagement from '@/components/loaning/LoaningManagement';

// Complete loan management interface
<LoaningManagement 
  clubId="club-uuid" 
  playerId="player-uuid" // Optional: pre-select player
/>
```

### Unified Player Manager

```tsx
import UnifiedPlayerManager from '@/components/player-manager/UnifiedPlayerManager';

// Enhanced player selection and management
<UnifiedPlayerManager 
  clubId="club-uuid"
  showExternalPlayers={true}
  onPlayerSelected={(player) => console.log('Selected:', player)}
/>
```

## üîç Analytics and Reporting

### Player Statistics

The system provides comprehensive analytics:

```typescript
// Get loan statistics for a club
const stats = await getLoanStats('club-uuid');
console.log(stats);
// {
//   total_loans: 15,
//   active_loans: 8,
//   expired_loans: 7,
//   loaned_in: 5,
//   loaned_out: 3
// }
```

### Club Player Summary

```typescript
// Get unified view of all player-manager
const players = await searchPlayers({
  club_id: 'club-uuid',
  is_active: true
});
```

## üö® Migration Considerations

### Data Migration
- Existing external players are automatically migrated
- No data loss during migration
- Backward compatibility maintained

### Breaking Changes
- External player functions are deprecated but still work
- New unified functions are recommended
- Database schema changes require migration

### Performance
- New indexes improve query performance
- Unified queries are more efficient
- Reduced complexity in application code

## üîß Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### 1. **Migration Fails**
- Check if external_players table exists
- Verify database permissions
- Review error messages in Supabase logs

#### 2. **Player Search Not Working**
- Ensure `search_players` function exists
- Check RLS policies
- Verify function permissions

#### 3. **Loan Creation Fails**
- Verify player exists
- Check club IDs are valid
- Ensure proper permissions

### Error Messages

- **"Player with ID does not exist"**: Player not found in database
- **"Active loan not found"**: Trying to end non-existent loan
- **"Permission denied"**: RLS policy blocking access

## üéØ Next Steps

### Immediate Actions
1. ‚úÖ Run database migration
2. ‚úÖ Update application code
3. ‚úÖ Test basic functionality
4. ‚úÖ Verify data integrity

### Future Enhancements
