# Club Overview Security Fix

## üö® Security Warning

**Issue**: View `public.club_overview` is defined with the `SECURITY DEFINER` property.

**Description**: Detects views defined with the `SECURITY DEFINER` property. These views enforce Postgres permissions and row level security policies (RLS) of the view creator, rather than that of the querying user.

## üîç Root Cause Analysis

The `club_overview` view was likely created with the `SECURITY DEFINER` property, which can be a security risk because:

1. **Privilege Escalation**: The view runs with the privileges of the view creator, not the querying user
2. **Bypass RLS**: Row Level Security policies of the querying user are bypassed
3. **Unintended Access**: Users might access data they shouldn't have access to

## üõ†Ô∏è Solution

### 1. Recreate the View Without SECURITY DEFINER

The `club_overview` view only contains public club information and aggregated counts, so it doesn't need `SECURITY DEFINER`:

```sql
-- Drop and recreate the view without SECURITY DEFINER
DROP VIEW IF EXISTS club_overview;

CREATE OR REPLACE VIEW club_overview AS
SELECT 
    c.id,
    c.name,
    c.short_name,
    c.city,
    c.founded_year,
    c.logo_url,
    c.is_active,
    COUNT(ct.team_id) as team_count,
    COUNT(cc.id) as category_count
FROM clubs c
LEFT JOIN club_teams ct ON c.id = ct.club_id
LEFT JOIN club_categories cc ON c.id = cc.club_id AND cc.is_active = true
GROUP BY c.id, c.name, c.short_name, c.city, c.founded_year, c.logo_url, c.is_active;
```

### 2. Apply Proper Permissions

```sql
-- Grant appropriate permissions
GRANT SELECT ON club_overview TO authenticated;
```

## üìã How to Apply the Fix

### Option 1: Automated Script (Recommended)

1. **Set up environment variables** in `.env.local`:
   ```bash
   NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=your_supabase_url
   SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=your_service_role_key
   ```

2. **Run the automated script**:
   ```bash
   cd scripts
   node fix-club-overview-security.js
   ```

### Option 2: Manual SQL Execution

1. **Go to Supabase Dashboard** ‚Üí **SQL Editor**
2. **Copy and paste** the contents of `scripts/fix_club_overview_security.sql`
3. **Execute the SQL script**
4. **Verify** the security warning disappears
